The plan for displaying the categories on the ludo cross...

#1
Sum up categories and make a list with which category it interacts... 
#2
make beforehand and hand to function (first one will be hardcoded)
let categorydata = [{"categories": [{"cat1": count(int),
                                    "cat2": count(int)}
                                    ],
                    "mechanics": [{"mech1": count(int),
                                "mech2": count(int)}
                                ]
                    "number_of_games": int,
                    "list_of_games": [...]}
]
#3
display category on canvas and have outer circle fixed, inner circle represents games in category

#4
devise some function to get categories into ludo form, first hardcode and then look for dynamic code later

#5
apply similar handle to mechanics

#6 
get some interaction when hovering over one cat/mech and indicate count to other mechs/cats with thickness of arrow

thoughts for optimisation
Use onMount/onDestroy function in svelte (especially for datawrangling)
For later: Display table below gameboard interacting with the board and have a filtermechanic

overall: functionality first, looks later
